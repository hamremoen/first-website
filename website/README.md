# HTML/CSS CA Planning

Get every picture into the "images" file.
Make an Index.html and Rainydays.css file.

Make a header
add content similar to my design 1 assignment (add changes if needed)

Make a body
add content similar to my design 1 assignment (add changes if needed)

Make a footer
add content similar to my design 1 assignment (add changes if needed) prefferably make this stick to the bottom, but not dissapear when scrolling


Test the website out in different browsers
Make sure my content is easily readable and understandable
Make sure every page is phone/tablet friendly

!REMEMBER TO CLEAN UP ANY "USELESS" CODE AT THE END!


problems:

jacket section (hover to pick size) did not work in mobile/tablet, have to redo

my items payment method (to open pop-up) literally impossible, have to move on

search bar in "navbar" (looks dreadful, cant place it on the same line as the other content), moving on
